She is considered to be very girly and is always complaining about getting her kimono dirty, which always ends up annoying Daichi. Her hair tied in a ponytail with hair decoration in the shape of sakura flowers. She is skilled in handling the naginata and dislikes getting muddy.\n\nTemari has the ability to perform Character Change with Nadeshiko. Nadeshiko then becomes battle hungry, often over little things like getting hit with a ball. Temari herself seems to have an anger problem. She says \"Chin, Ton, Shan\" during Character Change.",

When drawn in a more 'action-oriented' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.\n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.\n\n(Source: One Punch-Man Wiki)",
