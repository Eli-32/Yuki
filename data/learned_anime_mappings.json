She is considered to be very girly and is always complaining about getting her kimono dirty, which always ends up annoying Daichi. Her hair tied in a ponytail with hair decoration in the shape of sakura flowers. She is skilled in handling the naginata and dislikes getting muddy.\n\nTemari has the ability to perform Character Change with Nadeshiko. Nadeshiko then becomes battle hungry, often over little things like getting hit with a ball. Temari herself seems to have an anger problem. She says \"Chin, Ton, Shan\" during Character Change.",
